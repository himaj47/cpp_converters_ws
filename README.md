# C/C++ Structs to ROS2 Message Converter

[![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-online-blue)](https://himaj47.github.io/cpp_converters_doc/)

This project was developed during **Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025** under the guidance of Janosch Machowinski. 

Organization: **Open Robotics**

## Introduction

This package allow users to convert their **C/C++ structs into ROS2 messages and generate type adapters** automatically.  
This removes the need for developers to manually define message files or boilerplate conversion logic, making it easier to use C/C++ structures directly in ROS2.

---

## What Was Done

- **Core Python package (`stm_converter`)**:  
  - Uses `pygccxml` + `castxml` to parse C++ structs.  
  - Generates ROS2 messages files, type adapters using Jinja2 templates and maintains a registry (YAML) of autogenerated messages and adapters.  

- **CMake integration (`cpp_converter`)**:  
  - Provides the cmake function `convert_to_ros_msg` that uses stm_converter to generate artifacts.  

- **Examples & tests**:  
  - Demonstrated how to convert structs into ROS2 messages. 
  - Demonstrated publishing/subscribing with generated type adapters.    
  - Tests for message descriptions that are added to the registry.

---

## Whatâ€™s Left To Do

- Improve **ROS2 Jazzy support**.  
- Handling `opaque types` while generating artifacts.
- CI/CD for building + testing across ROS distros.  
- Optimize error handling in generator.
